\label{fig:PSA}
(a)
We calculated the first, second and third PSMs for each class. The PSMs of Motor and Social classes are shown here (see Appendix B Fig.\,\ref{fig:appendix_psa} for the other classes).
%
We recall that we intentionally omitted the class index in the formulation \eqref{eq:psm_rewrite} for simplicity, 
and that PSMs are actually meant to be computed for each class separately. 
% 
In the visualization of each PSM, we exclusivly colored the ROIs with values that are at least one s.d. away from the mean. 
%
Red and blue indicate different signs in the PSM values, i.e., the corresponding aROIs act oppositely in characterizing the class.
(b)
Similarity between maps was evaluated by cosine similarity.
We calculated the absolute value of cosine similarity (for definition, see the text) between all pairs of the first, second and third PSMs of the seven classes. Based on these similarity values, we applied a hierarchical clustering to the set of all the computed PSMs. 
The similarity matrix above is based on leaf order in the dendrogram (attached to the left side of the matrix) obtained by the hierarchical clustering. Intensity of the color indicates the degree of similarity.
